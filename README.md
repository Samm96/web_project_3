# Project 3: From Homeland to Homeland
## By Samantha Horsch via Practicum

*Project Description*

This is an introduction landing page coded based on a brief provided by the Practicum curriculum via Figma.

It consists of a brief opening section describing the goal and community of Practicum; a grid of photographs of locations where different contributors reside; and descriptions of five locations of contributors.

The goal of this project was work and familiarize students with Figma, an important universally-used website utilized by design teams and coders in the workforce as well as test how well we implement our learning from Sprint 1, 2 and added info from Sprint 3. 

The added skills include starting the coding from scratch as well as more CSS content such as grids and more pseudo-classes.
